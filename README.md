# Numeric Update Package

This package simplifies the implementation of updating a numerical value with each user tap on a container in a Flutter application. It streamlines the process of handling user interactions, making it easy for developers to integrate a counter or numerical update feature seamlessly.

## Features

- Easy integration for updating numerical values
- Simplifies user interaction logic
- Reduces code complexity

## Getting Started

To get started, simply call `CounterWidgetSec();` in your code.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the package in the `/example` folder:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:numeric_update_package/numeric_update_package.dart'; // Replace with the actual package import

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            children: [
              CounterWidgetSec(),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```
